# Connector

In this tutorial you will learn how to manage `Connectors` in the `Dataspace`. For this you need to already have an account with a username and an initial password.

# Activate Account

To activate your account you need to log in at http://vision-x-dataspace.base-x-ecosystem.org and set a new password. From there on you can use the Dashboard which is currently in development or continue with the steps documented here.
