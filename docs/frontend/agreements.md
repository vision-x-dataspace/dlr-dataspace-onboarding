!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Use the time period filter to focus on recent agreements and the search functionality to quickly locate specific agreements. The dashboard refreshes automatically after successful transfers, so you can monitor the progress of your data exchanges in real-time. Re-transfers can be useful for updating data or re-sending information when needed.
