!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Think of the Your Assets page as your personal data management hub. When preparing to share assets, consider organizing them into logical folders first, and applying descriptive names before creating offers. This makes your assets more discoverable and easier for other participants to understand their purpose and contents. In a future update, you'll be able to add rich metadata to assets, enhancing their discoverability in the marketplace.
