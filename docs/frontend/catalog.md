# Federated Catalog

Discover and access data assets across the entire dataspace.

The Federated Catalog serves as a marketplace for all available data assets within the DLR Dataspace. As a federated system, it allows you to browse and search for assets not only from your organization but from all participating organizations that have shared assets with the dataspace.

## Understanding the Federated Catalog

The Federated Catalog is a core component of the DLR Dataspace that aggregates asset information from all participating connectors:

- **Comprehensive view** - See all available assets from every participant who has made offers
- **Real-time updates** - The catalog continuously updates as new offers are created or existing ones are modified
- **Policy-aware browsing** - Only see assets that your organization has permission to access based on policies

## Search Functionality

The powerful search functionality helps you find exactly what you need:

- **Keyword search** - Search asset names, descriptions, and metadata
- **Provider filtering** - Find assets from specific organizations or connectors
- **Type filtering** - Filter by file types, formats, or categories
- **Advanced filters** - Filter by date added, size, and other attributes

## Asset Browsing

The catalog presents assets in an easy-to-browse format with rich metadata:

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    The Federated Catalog is constantly evolving as new assets are added. Check back regularly or set up notifications to stay informed about new data that might be relevant to your projects.
