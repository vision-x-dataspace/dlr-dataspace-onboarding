# BDRS

The `BDRS` (BPN DID Resolution Service) is responsible for providing a mapping between `BPNs` and `DIDs`.

## Management API

The `Management API` is used to manage the mapping. It is available at `/bdrs/management`, but only administrators have access to it. For detailled documentation on this API, see [BDRS management-api](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/bpn-did-resolution-service/openapi/management-api/).

## Directoy API

The `Directory API` can be use to retrieve the mapping. It is available at `/bdrs/directory`. For detailled documentation on this API, see [BDRS directoy-api](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/bpn-did-resolution-service/openapi/directory-api/).
